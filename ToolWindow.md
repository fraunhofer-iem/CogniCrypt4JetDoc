# CogniCrypt Tool Window

## Purpose 
Code markers are useful to indicate errors in a file at a specific location, however they are unable to reveal the scope of all findings of the analysis. Hence this Plugin comes with a convenient, dedicated Window that lists all findings without having the need all source files to be opened in the editor. Each finding listed in this window is linked to the source file and the reported line. 

## Features

- Lists all analysis Findings by CogniCrypt
- Provides information about the affected class and source code line number
- Prints the information of the findings. 
- By double clicking an entry the source file will be opened and the caret will be positioned to the correct line.

*This list is still WIP. More features are planned.*
